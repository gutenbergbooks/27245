<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>These pages are dedicated to those who are seeking light on the question
of rational living and to all who are suffering from the effects of
wrong living. Thought along this line expresses growth and progress, and
with it comes knowledge. Common sense and judgment, following a natural
instinct, will go a long way toward attaining better health. But those
who, through the constant use of cooked, or highly spiced and fermented
food, have lost their natural instincts and intuitions, will find the
study of the science of dietetical chemistry of inestimable value toward
a better understanding of natural laws, and be enabled to make the
selections and combinations of foods more suitable to their temperament.</p>

<p>Before the question as to meat eating and vegetarianism can be solved,
we must consider the first principle of nature, which is the law of
self preservation. Thereafter we may be able to think and strive to save
the lives of animals, now cruelly sacrificed largely for the sense
gratification of man. The artificial preparation of food is a fine art,
and no doubt has helped much toward the development of our central
nervous system.</p>

<p>The ordinary mixed diet with the addition of meat two or three times per
week is the safest method for most people who are compelled to work
eight, ten, or twelve hours out of every twenty-four and have to deprive
themselves of the proper amount of fresh air, sunshine and physical
exercise, which brings all the muscles and organs of the body into
proper action.</p>

<p>Inharmony, disease, and misfortune are largely caused by living a life
contrary to the laws of nature.</p>

<p>The fulfillment of high ideals must be accompanied by common sense and
judgment, so it becomes an evolution instead of revolution. The evolving
of man from the stage of a jelly fish to a being possessed of a bony
framework in an upright position by the eating of animals has developed
a higher self. After having reached this stage of evolution the nature
of some people has become so highly sensitized that meat, as a food,
becomes repugnant to them. What they need is a stepping stone. The very
food which has produced this state of over refinement or destruction
must be used for construction and minimized by degrees.</p>

<p>In examining the claims of the disciples of vegetarianism it is well to
consider those nations whose constitution and customs of work and
education resemble our own. And in doing so we find that while nearly
all European nations, as well as many of the Orient, practice moderation
in meat eating, still they are for the most part only "near
vegetarians," and therefore should not be used as examples in an
argument for vegetarianism.</p>

<p>It is possible for normal individuals under fairly normal conditions of
life to nourish perfectly their bodies on a vegetarian diet, provided
they are willing to live mainly on sun-kissed foods instead of on a mass
of sloppily-cooked, devitalized, starchy vegetables, and soft
nitrogenous foods that burden the digestive organs and produce obesity
and slow consumption.</p>

<p>I hope that the menus on the following pages will be a help to all who
seek simplicity from a standpoint of health as well as economy.</p>

<p>Note: For preparation of foods, consult Scientific Feeding.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Some people think that we become like the food we eat. This
is true when the vibrations of what we eat are stronger than
the vibrations in our bodies. All food consumed has a
vibration of its own and unless the vital force within can
change the rate of vibration of the food eaten and tune it to
the vibration of the body itself, one cannot become
nourished, or in other words "he becomes like the food he
eats." There is but one force or energy in the body, which is
life or "spirit." Under normal conditions this force has in
itself all the power to harmonize with the vibrations of the
foods taken into the body. Provided there is a demand for
food in the form of true hunger.</p>

<p>Natural diet, deep rhythmic breathing with corresponding
exercises awaken latent talents within us and rapid mental
and spiritual unfoldment takes place. Inharmony, disease and
pain are caused by living a life contrary to the laws of God
and Nature.</p>

</div>

<h2>HOW TO BECOME A VEGETARIAN.</h2>

<p>Adopting a vegetarian diet should be done with great care, and not in a
hurry, especially when the person is not in perfect health.</p>

<p>The best time to begin is the Spring. People who have lived on excessive
meat should cut it down to two and three times per week, substituting
cured meat and fish part of the time.</p>

<p>It may take months, or even years to educate the cells of the stomach to
act upon nuts, legumes, and other heavy protein foods, so as to be
properly nourished. An individual with great adaptability may make this
change without much discomfort, but many people who desire to leave off
meat, do so because they are already sick from wrong eating. If they
feel benefited by the change for a while it is generally because their
system is eliminating the toxins which are the result of excessive meat
eating. After this has taken place, the body requires food, properly
combined and proportioned, or else nerve starvation and obesity are the
result.</p>

<p>To those who for various reasons desire to adopt a vegetarian diet I
would say, do not substitute bread and vegetables for meat. Do not spend
your energy making new and complex dishes as advocated in fashionable
vegetarian cook books. Compounds containing several soft proteins such
as beans, nuts, eggs and cream, besides starches, are a burden to the
liver and alimentary canal and lay the foundation for new diseases.</p>

<p>If cooked foods are required, study carefully the preparation of
nutritious soups, well boiled cereals, salads, and add as many raw foods
as possible.</p>

<p>Exercise more in the open air, live and work in sunny well ventilated
rooms, retire early and live as close to nature as you can.</p>

<p>I hope that the following pages may serve as a stepping stone for all
who desire to eat less meat, as well as for those who wish to become
vegetarians.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In adopting a raw food diet, or in reducing heat-giving
elements, such as artificial sugars and hot drinks, it is
important to apply more external heat to the body for a
while, or else have the morning meal served in a sunny room.
Plenty of outdoor exercise is necessary to properly utilize a
vegetarian diet.</p>

</div>

<h2>FOOD REQUIREMENTS.</h2>

<p>It is important that the diet should contain the proper amount of
protein, starches and fats, suitable to the individual needs. Age,
weight, height, occupation, season and climate must all be considered.
Numerous and careful researches regarding food requirements made during
the last fifty years have led to the realization that the majority of
civilized men and women consume from two to three times the amount of
food necessary.</p>

<h2>FOOD FOR THE AGED.</h2>

<p>Many people at the ages of sixty and seventy still lead an active life,
while others retire from activity at forty-five or fifty. Therefore, the
food should conform to the person's mental and physical requirements. If
the teeth are poor and the digestive powers weak, the food should be
light, consisting mainly of well cooked cereals, baked potatoes, rice,
cooked greens, a small amount of meat, raw fruits and raw greens in
combination with fatty foods, as salads, milk and buttermilk, toasted
breads and soups.</p>

<p>The total fuel requirement depends upon whether the individual leads a
quiet or active existence. For a person who lives mainly indoors, and
makes little use of the muscles of the arms, shoulders and trunk, 1000
to 1200 calories is sufficient for twenty-four hours. If more food is
eaten than the body requires, the excess will manifest itself by the
development of chronic ailments and obesity, or feeble-mindedness.</p>

<p>The morning and evening meals should consist of fluid and semi-fluid
foods, or of toasted breads and salads. Meats, eggs (except the yolks),
cheese, beans, peas and nuts should be eaten only during the middle of
the day in small quantities. One can cut down his amount of food greatly
by thoroughly chewing each morsel. The demand for protein at this period
is small, while the amount of fat should be increased.</p>

<h2>WHAT SHALL WE DRINK WITH OUR MEALS?</h2>

<p>This question is often asked. It depends entirely on the quality and
combination of food which is eaten.</p>

<p>A diet consisting of a variety of solids and vegetables with excessive
fluids gives the stomach nothing to do; the contents pass at once into
the intestines. Such mixtures are ingested instead of being digested;
they cannot be fully utilized because stimulation upon the drainage of
the body is lacking.</p>

<p>If dry foods are eaten, such as sandwiches, rice, macaroni, potatoes or
dry cereals, without the addition of fruits, vegetables or soups, a
small amount of liquid should be taken. Such simple foods do not form a
perfect meal, therefore milk or broths are preferable to water. Water is
best taken from five to fifteen minutes before the meal or from one to
two hours after meals.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Note: These pages are not a perfected plan of right eating to
be slavishly followed. Each man is a law unto himself, and
with a little self-study and practical application this book
may be worth its weight in gold to the true student of
natural laws.</p>

combinations are absolutely harmful to every individual,
others are either harmful to certain temperaments, or, to mix

of the day; the former prepared in salad dressing or boiled
custards; the latter in the form of baked eggs with lemon and

<p>Learn by experience to select the kinds of food which yield
nourishment and avoid those which disagree.</p>

</div>

<h2>MENUS FOR DINNER.</h2>

<div class="block">

<p>All who are in the habit of eating more than their systems
require and especially those who indulge in large amounts of
bread at dinner, would do well to begin their meal with a
soup. Legume and cream soups will furnish a satisfactory meal
by themselves. Take toast or sun-dried bread at the end of
the meal, with black coffee or postum.</p>

<p>For people of a bilious temperament eggs should not be mixed
with milk or sweet foods at the same meal. Tomatoes, tart
apples or green leaves, raw or cooked, are anti-bilious
foods.</p>

<p>If certain foods do not agree, or produce indigestion, study
their combination and preparation carefully, also the
proportion and time of the day when most suitable. If this
does not prove satisfactory leave them alone.</p>

<h2>DIET AND HYGIENE FOR BRAIN WORKERS.</h2>

<p>Proper growth and activity of the brain and nervous system are promoted
by a healthy flow of blood. Pure air and sufficient food properly
combined and proportioned are essential. Choose more of the lighter
forms of protein and starchy foods, as fish, eggs, almonds, green peas,
bacon, a moderate amount of lamb and beef, rice, sago, wheat, and
vegetable gelatines. Foods rich in minerals are celery, apples,
tomatoes, greens, oranges, and practically all the fresh fruits and
vegetables, especially the small berries. Melons and starchy vegetables
in large quantities are suitable for muscular workers. Use as little as
possible of so-called pure chemical substances, such as refined sugar
and flour.</p>

<p>Avoid poisonous beverages, tobacco and all forms of drugs. Sleep at
least nine hours in a well ventilated room, facing east or south. Avoid
constipation. Combine mental work with moderate amounts of useful and
enjoyable exercise and physical work. Protect the eyes from strong
artificial light. Keep the feet warm. Relax before and after meals. A
certain amount of manual labor is absolutely necessary for the
brain-worker. It favors deep breathing and creates a demand for more air
and water, and thus improves digestion, oxidation and nutrition. The
body poisons are carried off quicker and nervous headaches and
despondency are avoided. Short walks out of doors before retiring are
very beneficial for people who suffer with cold hands and feet.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Dress by an open fire or in a sunny room. A chill before
breakfast produces indigestion and a desire for unnecessary
hot foods. Never sleep by night lamps or any other artificial
light. They are injurious to the eyes and absorb oxygen.</p>

<p>Avoid fresh breads, inferior cakes and pastry. Do not eat
unless you are hungry. Do not over-indulge in athletic or any
other kind of exercise. Remember that natural feeding, pure
air and sufficient sleep call for natural breathing and
natural exercise. Unnatural feeding and late hours create
disease or nervousness.</p>

</div>

<h2>"THE IMMIGRANT."</h2>

<p>All who leave the land of their birth should make themselves acquainted
with the art of living and the peculiarities of the new country in which
they intend to live.</p>

<p>To depart entirely from their old customs and habits is as dangerous as
to neglect the study of the new environment or the failure to adopt
necessary changes.</p>

<p>In some portions of the United States the climatic conditions are very
changeable; we have extreme heat and cold, an excess of rain with wind
storms and dryness alternating within a short time. West of the Rocky
Mountains we have a mild sea air. In the Southern States and near the
Pacific Coast we have low districts where malaria and catarrhal
conditions are easily acquired.</p>

<p>Tropical fruits and vegetables which are looked upon as luxuries in
Northern Europe are necessary articles of food in the country where they
grow, therefore the stranger should make himself acquainted with such
foods, and by degrees learn to eat them.</p>

<h2>TRAINING CHILDREN IN CORRECT HABITS OF EATING.</h2>

<p>A child should have his face and hands washed before and after each
meal. He should not be allowed to carry foodstuffs and candy about the
house, or touch carpets and furniture with sticky and greasy fingers. If
he requires food between meals, give him four or five meals per day, but
have him eat his food in the proper place.</p>

<p>The breeding of flies, mosquitoes and other disease carriers is greatly
favored by allowing children to eat at any and all times without
napkins, or special preservation of their dress, or without cleaning
their hands before and after eating, or before and after playing with
animals and pets.</p>

<p>The American child is given too much consideration at the table. There
is a great difference between the saying "I don't like a certain food"
and "I don't want it," because there are things which taste better.</p>

<p>To leave one's plate half full of foodstuffs and ask for, or accept,
other food is customary, but before the law of our Creator it is unclean
and disrespectful, wasteful and dangerous.</p>

<p>The physiological laws of our bodies are based on very economical plans:
nature utilizes everything and wastes nothing. Cooked foodstuffs,
whether they are wasted within our bodies by over-indulgence, or in the
garbage can, create decomposition and germs.</p>

<h2>MENUS FOR DINNER FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.</h2>

<div class="block">
<ol>
<li>One-half orange, one ounce boiled fish, one-half of an apple,

<li>One-half of an apple, one or two eggs, one to two tablespoons

<li>Legume soup, butter and bread, raw carrots.</li>

<li>Light rice with cold grated Swiss cheese.</li>
<li>Cereal salad with apple and eggs.</li>
<li>Lettuce, baked potatoes, beachnut bacon and one egg.</li>

<li>String beans with stale bread and butter, bacon and egg.</li>
<li>Finely chopped spinach, bacon, egg, stale bread, butter.</li>
<li>Three to five cherries, light omelet, lettuce.</li>
<li>Cereal salad with apples, two to three tablespoons of cottage
cheese.</li>
<li>Baked oats with prunes or cranberry sauce and bacon.</li>
<li>Whole wheat with sterilized cream and celery.</li>
<li>Peach and cereal salad, beachnut bacon and one egg.</li>
<li>Baked potato greens, meat, egg or fish.</li>
<li>Legume puree or soup, carrots, bacon.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Legumes are a very important food for young children, and their use
should begin during the second year. They are easily digested if
prepared in the form of soups and purees, and combined as directed in
the different menus. They should not be given at night.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mothers of girls should think it more important to furnish
healthful exercise, wholesome food and restful sleep during
the years of budding womanhood, than to worry about lessons
in music and art, or a business education. All these can be
taken up with much greater benefit after maturity. Arrested
development of the organs of reproduction will lay the
foundation for many years of unhappiness and suffering.</p>

<p>Many parents are impressed with the idea that their children
require a large amount of sweets, in order to make them grow.
We cannot force nature without paying the penalty. At
maturity, we reap what has been sown for us, or what we have
sown for ourselves.</p>

<p>Your book, "The Epicure of Medicine," is worth its weight in
gold.</p>

<p class="right">
DR. F. SCHURMANN, Honolulu, T. H. (The Schurmann Institute).</p>

<p>A knowledge based on such experience is worthy of the
profoundest consideration. This accounts for the sincerity of
the mode of writing.</p>

<p class="right">
DR. AXEL EMIL GIBSON, Los Angeles, Cal.</p>

<p>The book is interesting and has value. The author's account
of her own struggles with disease leads one to wonder how she
could be alive and able to write a book. Few such struggles
have ever been recorded. It is interesting to follow the
author in her account of the combats she has had with the
disease. There are many new and strange teachings in the book
of which we shall express no opinion.</p>

<p class="right">
THE THERAPEUTIC RECORD, Louisville, Ky.</p>

<p>The study of the book shows that the author, like many
American physicians, is not a staunch believer in "drug
cures," but considers that spiritual, mental and physical
healing applied in the natural way are the only means to
produce chemical changes within our bodies.</p>

<p class="right">
PRACTICAL MEDICINE, Delhi, India.</p>

<p>After a careful reading and understanding of DR. ROPER'S new
work, I can heartily endorse her efforts to bring the right
style of living before the people. Such a work as this seems
a blessing to humanity.</p>

<p class="right">
MRS. LOTTIE HALL, Pres. of Lincoln School Mothers' Club, Berkeley.</p>

<p>The only cook book which I have seen, which gives the proper
chemical combinations for each meal of the day.</p>

<p class="right">
MRS. ESTHER TALBOTT, Oakland, Cal.</p>

<p>Your book deserves to be circulated by the millions. Our club
would consider it a favor if you could give us a lecture and
demonstration on nutritious soups.</p>

<p class="right">
MRS. IDA HOUGHTALING, Berkeley, Cal.</p>

<p>"Scientific Feeding" is an open door to health. After being
under the care and supervision of DR. ROPER for two months I
feel confident that she has knowledge which leads to health
through right living.</p>

<p class="right">
MISS ELISABETH JEWETT, Kindergarten Director, Cleveland, O.</p>

<p>Your book is a regular gold mine. I particularly like the
chapter, "Study of Food." A copy should be in every school
